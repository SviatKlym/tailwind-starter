1. Lets Enhance all Components in "Block" tab, I mean all what inside .components-button.components-panel__body-toggle accordion (.components-flex.components-h-stack.components-v-stack) becaude its looks like not styled , we should to fix it and make it more user frienldy and with better UX/UI.
2. core block Spacer - the Height is not applying and lets hide in this component this part data-wp-component="ToolsPanel"
3. In all core blocks we have ðŸ“± Visual Design Controls I would like to change it to the same structure "Block" and "Design" like in custom blocks.
5. In all custom blocks "Block" tabs we have an accordions with block settings . But it's works strange on open they are shift and increased width . I think we should to make it with better UX/UI and user friendly interface.
