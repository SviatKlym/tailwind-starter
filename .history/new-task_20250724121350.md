1. Lets Enhance all Components in "Block" tab, I mean all what inside .components-button.components-panel__body-toggle accordion (.components-flex.components-h-stack.components-v-stack) becaude its looks like not styled , we should to fix it and make it more user frienldy and with better UX/UI.
2. core block Spacer - the Height is not applying and lets hide in this component this part data-wp-component="ToolsPanel"
3. In enhanced core blocks lets instead const designControls - src\utils\core-block-enhancements.js  lets use src\utils\visual-controls.js .
4. FOr controls like Stats Managment , Slides Managment and etc lets create Modal window with settings. I think I would be better in UX/UI.
5. Move rewite all custom blocks to dynamic gutenberg blocks Lets  rewrite all frontend layout part like render.php  because its broken now and not fit to editor part.
