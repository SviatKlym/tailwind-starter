## Implementation Status & Technical Guide

### âœ… Completed Blocks (5/16)
1. **heroWithCta** - âœ… COMPLETE
2. **pricingTable** - âœ… COMPLETE  
3. **featureGrid-enhanced** - âœ… COMPLETE
4. **socialProof** - âœ… COMPLETE
5. **ctaSection** - âœ… COMPLETE

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

#### Block Architecture
All custom blocks follow this standardized structure:
```
/src/blocks/[block-name]/
â”œâ”€â”€ block.json           # Block metadata and attributes
â”œâ”€â”€ edit.js             # React editor component
â”œâ”€â”€ save.js             # Frontend output component
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js            # Block registration
â””â”€â”€ style.scss          # Block-specific styles
```

#### Essential Block Components
1. **UltimateControlTabs Integration**
   - All blocks use `/src/utils/visual-controls.js` for advanced styling controls
   - Required props: `spacing`, `margins`, `background`, `textColor`, `gradients`, `typography`, `layout`, `effects`
   - Each prop needs corresponding `onChange` callback
   - Example implementation:
   ```javascript
   <UltimateControlTabs
     spacing={settings.spacing || {}}
     onSpacingChange={(spacing) => setAttributes({
       settings: { ...settings, spacing }
     })}
     // ... all other required props
   />
   ```

2. **Device-Responsive Settings**
   - All blocks include `activeDevice` attribute for responsive design
   - Use `UltimateDeviceSelector` component
   - Settings structure: `{ base: {}, mobile: {}, tablet: {} }`

3. **Class Generation System**
   - Import: `generateAllClasses`, `generateTailwindClasses` from visual-controls.js
   - All blocks generate responsive Tailwind classes
   - Preview uses base classes, full output includes all devices

#### Block Registration Pattern
```javascript
// /src/index.js - Add new blocks here
import './blocks/[new-block-name]'
```

#### Required Attribute Structure
Every block must include these base attributes:
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "type": "object",
    "default": {
      "spacing": { "base": { "top": 8, "right": 4, "bottom": 8, "left": 4 } },
      "margins": { "base": { "top": 0, "right": 0, "bottom": 0, "left": 0 } },
      "typography": { "base": { "fontSize": "text-lg", "fontWeight": "font-normal", "textAlign": "text-center" } },
      "backgroundColor": "bg-white",
      "textColor": "text-gray-900",
      "gradients": {},
      "layout": {},
      "effects": {}
    }
  },
  "activeDevice": {
    "type": "string", 
    "default": "base"
  }
}
```

#### UI/UX Standards Implemented
- **Visual Design Studio Styling**: All blocks use preset-grid layouts for controls
- **Preset Button System**: Layout selectors use visual cards instead of dropdowns
- **Emoji Icons**: Enhanced labels with contextual emojis for better UX
- **Responsive Design Indicators**: Device badges show current editing context
- **Generated Output Panels**: Display live Tailwind classes for debugging

#### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **"T is not a function" errors**: Replace WordPress Button components with div elements in editor previews
2. **"a is not a function" errors**: Ensure all UltimateControlTabs props have proper onChange callbacks
3. **Missing import extensions**: Add `.js` to all local imports
4. **Undefined settings**: Provide complete default settings structure in block.json

#### Visual Controls System
- Located: `/src/utils/visual-controls.js` (2,389 lines)
- Provides: UltimateControlTabs, UltimateDeviceSelector, class generation functions
- CSS Classes: `.preset-grid`, `.preset-button` for Visual Design Studio styling
- Performance: Includes debouncing and performance monitoring

### ðŸŽ¯ Future Development Guide
When creating new blocks:
1. Copy structure from existing completed block (e.g., pricingTable)
2. Update block.json with specific attributes
3. Implement UltimateControlTabs with ALL required props
4. Add to /src/index.js registration
5. Use Visual Design Studio styling patterns for controls
6. Test with device selector and class generation
