1. core block Spacer - the Height is not applying and lets hide in this component this part data-wp-component="ToolsPanel"
2. In enhanced core blocks lets instead const designControls - src\utils\core-block-enhancements.js  lets use src\utils\visual-controls.js .
3. FOr controls like Stats Managment , Slides Managment and etc lets create Modal window with settings. I think I would be better in UX/UI.
4. Move rewite all custom blocks to dynamic gutenberg blocks Lets  rewrite all frontend layout part like render.php  because its broken now and not fit to editor part.
